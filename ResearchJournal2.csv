left;Natalie Miebach;Boston Based Artist, 1972;Nathalie Miebach's work focuses on the intersection of art and science and the visual articulation of scientific observations. Her woven sculptures interpret scientific data related to astronomy, ecology and meteorology in three-dimensional space. Her pieces simulatneously function as works of art, aural embodiments of data (musical compositions) and instruments that illustrate environmental change. By utilizing artistic processes and everyday materials, Miebach questions and expands the boundaries of traditional science data visualization -- and provokes expectations of what visual vocabulary is considered to be in the domain of science and art. ;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57019fefd51cd411818396cd/09159c2d-25d0-474f-a738-9a733be0039f/IanandNicoleGallery.jpg;;Ian and Nicole, 2023, 15'x9'x1';;https://www.ted.com/speakers/nathalie_miebach;Science, Art, Data; 
leftDoubleImage;Rjoyi Ikeda;Japanese Visual & Sound Artist, 1966;Japan�s leading composer and visual artist Ryoji Ikeda focuses on the essential characteristics of sound itself and that of visuals as light by means of both mathematical precision and mathematical aesthetics. Ikeda has gained a reputation as one of the few international artists working convincingly across both visual and sonic media. He elaborately orchestrates sound, visuals, materials, physical phenomena, and mathematical notions into immersive live performances and installations. Alongside pure musical activity, Ikeda has been working on long-term projects through live performances, installations, books, and CDs.;https://media.hero-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11110009/HERO_RYOJI_IKEDA_2.jpg;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9e2752e-11a5-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1;the transfinite, 2011, mixed media,;data-verse 1, 2019, DCI-4K DLP projector, computer, speakers;https://www.alminerech.com/artists/411-ryoji-ikeda;Sonics, DigitalInstallation, Art, Visual;
left;Adam Ho;Malaysian Designer;"Growing up in New York, Malaysian designer Adam Ho says he was drawn to his father�s skill with a pencil. �My dad loves to draw, so I latched onto that kernel of creativity early on,� he recalls. �I remember at the age of six, my dad taught me how to draw my Chinese name in this insane hybrid-outlined-yet-cartoon-like calligraphic script, and in retrospect, that�s probably where my love for typography began.� This fascination eventually blossomed into a fully fledged career in design, as well as the founding of a personal design studio, through which Adam works for brands such as Airbnb, Dropbox and Medium among others. Meanwhile, his personal projects include Liquidities, a small collection of 10 abstract motion expressions, meant to look generative, but each of which were created frame-by-frame in �a very lo-fi process�; as well as another ongoing series of artworks that involves �an abstract and analogue twist (similar to Liquidities) but with a Y2K spirit and aesthetic.� In these endeavours, Adam says he enjoys the creative freedom and ability to experiment with different approaches and technology, forming a symbiotic relationship with his commercial work through providing him with new tools to apply to branding projects.";https://media.itsnicethat.com/original_images/Liquidities_Art_-_Kiwi_Print.gif;;A9-Kiwi Print (Expressions), 2022, Digital Media;;https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/adam-ho-graphic-design-discover-080623;Graphic Design, Web Design, Typography, LoFi, MotionGraphics;

It was founded during the worldwide covid lockdowns when cultural institutions were delivering a whole load of online exhibitions and conferences to keep cooped-up creatives inspired. This got Naree Shin and Dahyun Hwang thinking about how they could contribute to this creative movement. They came up with a simple yet brilliant formula: �Let�s create a regular meet-up that exists only in the virtual world, communicate through the internet,� and, most importantly �use web tools!�. At the moment their efforts revolve around one core project, the Alphabet project. This intricate series involves using HHHA�s random word selector to pick a random word every two weeks. After initially sharing ideas collectively on Google jamboard, each creative goes off individually to work on an innovative interpretation of the word through web language. The HHHA collaborators call these experiments �croquis drawn on the web�.;https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/51NpjzIGvS3-YCUKHf8Ob3_bWx0=/227009/width-1440/HHHA-web-design-itsnicethat3.jpg;;HHHA Alphabet Project, 2022;;https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/hejhellohalloannyeong-digital-230522;CreativeGroup, InteractiveDesign, Web, Art;
left;David Bowen;USA based Artist and Sculptor, 1974;David Bowen is a studio artist and educator known for his kinetic sculptures that are driven by real-world data from natural phenomena. While technology has enabled us to control and model phenomena with unprecedented precision, it may also provide a means to understand the world in a more intimate, visceral way. He is currently an Associate Professor of Sculpture and Physical Computing at the University of Minnesota. This installation enables a live plant to control a machete. plant machete has a control system that reads and utilizes the electrical noises found in a live philodendron. The system uses an open source microcontroller connected to the plant to read varying resistance signals across the plant�s leaves. Using custom software, these signals are mapped in real-time to the movements of the joints of the industrial robot holding a machete. In this way, the movements of the machete are determined based on input from the plant. Essentially the plant is the brain of the robot controlling the machete determining how it swings, jabs, slices and interacts in space.;https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/lb-plant-machete-OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1;;Plant Machete, 2023;;https://melbourne.sciencegallery.com/not-natural-exhibits/plant-machete   https://www.dwbowen.com/plant-machete;PlantMachete, Installation, InteractiveArt, Kinetic, Sculpture;
left;Neil Mendoza;British Installation Artist, 1983;Neil Mendoza is an artist who blends sculpture and engineering to animate objects and spaces. He employs humor and absurdity as tools to investigate how we mediate our interactions with each other and the natural world. His art often repurposes found objects, offering viewers a fresh perspective that challenges their preconceptions.  Spambots explores questions around AI and industrial farming. AI is increasingly used to generate spam content. Spambots explores what would happen if, instead, machine learning was used to empower a group of robotic Spam cans to tell their tales. Each Spambot has a small keyboard with four letters on it and when they collaborate they are able type the whole alphabet along with some punctuation. The text they are typing is generated by a neural network fine tuned on a version of Aldous Huxley�s Brave New World where occasional words have been swapped out for pig-related ones. In this novel each character is born into a caste in much the same way industrial farm animals, such as those that end up in Spam, are born into their fate.;https://www.hopeandglorypr.com/wp-content/uploads/spambots.png;;Spambot, 2023;;https://melbourne.sciencegallery.com/not-natural-exhibits/spambots     https://www.neilmendoza.com/portfolio/spambots/;Spambot, AI, Art, Installation;

left;Sofia Crespo;Argentinian Artist, 1994;Sofia Crespo is an artist working with a huge interest in biology-inspired technologies. One of her main focuses is the way organic life uses artificial mechanisms to simulate itself and evolve, this implying the idea that technologies are a biased product of the organic life that created them and not a completely separated object. Crespo looks at the similarities between techniques of AI image formation, and the way that humans express themselves creatively and cognitively recognize their world. Her work brings into question the potential of AI in artistic practice and its ability to reshape our understanding of creativity. On the side, she is also hugely concerned with the dynamic change in the role of the artists working with machine learning techniques. She currently works as part of the artistic duo Entangled Others.;https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/web-chimera_3456.jpg?w=1024;;Web Chimera (Neural Zoo), 2018-20;;https://sofiacrespo.com/;Technology, Art, AI, Installation;
left;John Provencher;American Digital Artist, 1987;John Provencher is an independent artist, designer and educator practicing in brooklyn, new york. Within these disciplines, he uses the generative nature of software as a medium to shape projects both on and offline. He is currently a member of the New Museum's New Inc Program and teaches at the New School. Harnessing the noisy patterns of early video game aesthetics, John Provencher�s LORE series is an ongoing study of digital figures that feel strikingly familiar, yet wholly unique. The artist, designer, and creative programmer plays with generative systems to produce multilayered forms. His dotted arrays of brilliant color recall printmaking, pointillism, or the binary construction of Jacquard-woven tapestries. After being gifted a Mac G3 for his birthday, he scavenged through relics of old files and software, entranced by how the monitor itself renders images. With only 256 colors in its system palette, the computer uses a digital imaging process called dithering to create the illusion of depth of color. Over the last few years, he�s returned to the Mac to make detailed pixelations in collaboration with his own script.  Provencher�s LORE series, presented by Forever Projects, uses a combination of media to evoke elements from an imagined video game. His three-part process involves prompting collaged figures using GAN tooling, and then rendering them through a custom dithering script before reproducing them in multiple color variations. He then uploads them to the Mac G3 to capture the final screenshot�complete with a retro window border.;https://outland.art/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JohnProvencher-Maps-RachelCabitt-18-1024x683.jpg;;Outputs from John Provencher�s�A Map is a Score, 2022;;https://verse.works/john-provencher    https://foundation.app/blog/forever-john-provencher-lore;DigitalArt, GenerativeArt, ImageProcessing, Color;
leftDoubleImage;Max Jala;Kuala Lumpur Visual Artist;It was while working as a mobile app developer that Max Jala first fell in love with the process of coding. �The constant puzzles and headaches presented by code are somehow very therapeutic,� he tells us. He eventually went on to quit his job and now works as a visual artist in Kuala Lumpur, specializing in generative and interactive installation art. Funnily enough, when Max first quit his job, he had no idea what creative coding even was, he just knew he wanted to pursue something more creative. �I was actually prepared to drop programming entirely,� he recalls. �It was only later in 2018, a few months after leaving my job, that I discovered generative art and realised that code could be an artistic tool. At that point it just seemed like a natural fit so I started messing around making small little animations with code.� With several other works recently completed, Max�s portfolio is an exciting one to be keeping up to date with, especially as someone with just one short year under his belt. As Max puts it, �the first time coding purely for art was a liberating experience for me,� and so, we can�t wait to see how his practice expands from here.;https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/Gj45w0UK-VdWzE5189B2lIB_5MA=/179858/format-webp%7Cwidth-1440/max-jala-digital-itsnicethat-12.JPG;https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/H0PbrqhiiWQocszfRjuutMl6Zaw=/179860/format-webp%7Cwidth-2880/max-jala-digital-itsnicethat-7.jpg;Multi-sensory Creative Coding Project;Multi-sensory Creative Coding Project;https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/max-jala-digital-210220;CreativeCoding, VisualArt, InteractiveArt, Generative;
